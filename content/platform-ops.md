{{< title1 "Platform Operations: a dedicated team of engineers, built upon resilience engineering principles" >}}

Flanksource operations are a little different to traditional vendor support.

> Flanksource operations have a singular focus: increasing and maintaining adaptive capacity within the platform and, more importantly, within the team.

As resilience engineering practitioners, we subscribe to the principle that the ability to adapt to change in complex systems is paramount. While we try and build robust and reliable systems that are designed to withstand known failure modes, we accept that it is the unknowns that ultimately bring down most systems.

To learn more about resilience engineering see:

<h3 class="subtitle is-4"><span><i class="fa fa-ban"></i></span> More than Email and Phone Support</h3>

We don't provide email or phone support. The traditional model of support where a ticket is opened and assigned to a random on-call engineer is deeply flawed. A random engineer cannot quickly reconstruct a picture of a complex system, either as it's designed or in its current state. This leads to long, convoluted conversations requesting logs and screen-sharing. Often, randomly-assigned engineers resort to trial and error to resolve an issue.

Flanksource changes all that.

<h3 class="subtitle is-4"><span ><i class="fa fa-people-carry"></i></span> Partnership not Support</h3>

Flanksource can act as a dedicated, standalone platform operations team. However, we prefer to fully integrate into your existing teams. When they're integrated into your team, Flanksource engineers feel your pain. They'll work alongside your engineers, committing to the same pipelines and troubleshooting using the same tools.

<h3 class="subtitle is-4"><span><i class="fa fa-cogs" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> Technology Agnostic</h3>

We are technology agnostic (as long as it's Kubernetes). Flanksource supports pure upstream Kubernetes, OpenShift and Essentials PKS, EKS, GKE and AKS.

See [Technology](./technology) for the full list of technologies we currently work with.
