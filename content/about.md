{{< article-left title="Lean First" img="agile.svg" >}}
Failure is inevitable: our policy is to declare it quickly and learn fast. We focus exclusively on platforms and voluntarily exit engagements where we don’t add value.<br>

We make decisions empirically and quickly, using clear frameworks:<br>
•	Simple > Complex (KISS)<br>
•	People > Principles > Practises > Tools<br>

{{< article-left title="Safety as a Prerequisite" img="safety.svg" height="100px" >}}
We believe that safety needs to be built-in, not an afterthought. This applies to:<br>
o	Infrastructure/Platforms<br>
o	Processes and Practises<br>
o	People (Psychological Safety)<br>

Safety requires continuous testing to ensure the things we trust work as expected (trust, but verify).<br>
