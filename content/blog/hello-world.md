Flanksource launched in January 2020 as a lean-first company focusing exclusively on Kubernetes.

### Behind the Name

[flank speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flank_speed) is a nautical term referring to a ship's true maximum speed i.e. Flanksource is the engine that enables companies to reach their true potential.


### Vision
Flanksource's vision is to see the large number of companies adopting Kubernetes realize its true value through high penetration into their legacy on-premise application stacks - not just the greenfields cloud-native applications where Kubernetes finds most of its success today.

### Chief Kubernetes Officer (CKO)

One of the many tasks required when starting a company is choosing what title to put on your business card. I chose *CKO* - in part as a play on words on [CKA](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/) and [Helmsman](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) - but more importantly as a signal of the deep-seated aspiration we at Flanksource have for CKOs to become as common as Chief Digital Officers are today.

You might wonder how you could possibly compare a lowly container orchestrator to a full-blown digital transformation. If Kubernetes was just a container orchestrator, you would be right - but Kubernetes is so much more - to see why read [Kubernetes is NOT a Container Orchestrator](../kubernetes-is-not-container-orchestrator).
