<h5 class="subtitle is-4">Tier 1</h5>
<p style="padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px;">
Tier 1 technologies are at our core. To ensure we do not dilute our skill set, all customer engagements must be based on these technologies. <br>
Flanksource frequently participates in, and contributes back to, Tier 1 upstream communities. We also maintain CI/CD pipelines and integration environments enabling rapid reproducibility of issues, testing and hotfixes when required. <br></p>

<h5 class="subtitle is-4">Tier 2</h5>
<p style="padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px;">
Technologies grouped under the Tier 2 banner are still considered part of our core competency. Our approach differs in that Flanksource does not make strategic investments or participate as much in the upstream community, in comparison to Tier 1.

<h5 class="subtitle is-4">Tier 3</h5>

<p style="padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px;">
We also actively build and support Tier 3 technologies. However, we avoid placing them into the critical path without upstream or commercial support agreements. Our team often has members who are experts in the individual technologies, but we do not currently have an on-call rotation that enables production-grade support.

We specialize in VMware based around on-premise deployments that stretch into AWS and Azure clouds.
